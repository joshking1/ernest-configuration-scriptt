# "$EUID" is a special variable in Bash shell that contains the numeric value of the current user's effective user ID.

# In the expression "$EUID" -ne 0, "-ne" is a comparison operator which means "not equal". So the expression means that if the effective user ID of the current user is not equal to 0, then the condition is true. In other words, the script is checking whether the user running the script has root privileges because the root user has an effective user ID of 0.

# Therefore, the expression is commonly used at the beginning of a script to check whether the script is being executed with root privileges. If the condition is true, the script will terminate or exit with an error message since some commands may require root privileges to run successfully.
