"$EUID" is a special variable in Bash shell that contains the numeric value of the current user's effective user ID.

In the expression "$EUID" -ne 0, "-ne" is a comparison operator which means "not equal". So the expression means that if the effective user ID of the current user is not equal to 0, then the condition is true. In other words, the script is checking whether the user running the script has root privileges because the root user has an effective user ID of 0.

Therefore, the expression is commonly used at the beginning of a script to check whether the script is being executed with root privileges. If the condition is true, the script will terminate or exit with an error message since some commands may require root privileges to run successfully.

In Bash shell, comparison operators are used to compare values or expressions and return a Boolean result (true or false) depending on whether the comparison is true or false. Here are some of the commonly used comparison operators in Bash:

-eq: used to check if two integers are equal.

-ne: used to check if two integers are not equal.

-gt: used to check if the first integer is greater than the second integer.

-ge: used to check if the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer.

-lt: used to check if the first integer is less than the second integer.

-le: used to check if the first integer is less than or equal to the second integer.

==: used to check if two strings are equal.

!=: used to check if two strings are not equal.

-z: used to check if a string is empty.

-n: used to check if a string is not empty.


These comparison operators are usually used in conditional statements such as if-else statements and loops to execute certain actions based on the result of the comparison.

# Condition Expression 
The expression [ -x "$(command -v docker)" ] is a conditional statement that checks whether the docker command is available in the current shell's environment. Here's how it works:

The $(command -v docker) command uses the command utility to locate the docker executable in the system's $PATH.

The $() syntax is used to capture the output of the command -v docker command as a string.

The -x option used in the conditional statement checks if the string that represents the path to the docker executable file is executable.

If the docker command is found and is executable, the expression evaluates to true and the code block within the if statement is executed.

In summary, the [ -x "$(command -v docker)" ] expression checks whether the docker command is available and can be executed, and executes a code block if it's not found.

# [ ]

In bash scripting, square brackets ([]) are used to enclose a conditional expression. The expression inside the square brackets is evaluated as true or false, and based on the result, the script can take different actions.

In the specific case of [ -x "$(command -v docker)" ], the -x flag checks if the file is executable, and $(command -v docker) is a command substitution that returns the path to the docker executable. The expression as a whole is checking if the docker executable is installed and is executable by the current user.

Note that square brackets are not the only way to enclose a conditional expression in bash. Double parentheses (()), and double square brackets [[ ]] are also used for this purpose. However, there are subtle differences in the behavior of each construct, and square brackets are often used as the default choice.
