"$EUID" is a special variable in Bash shell that contains the numeric value of the current user's effective user ID.

In the expression "$EUID" -ne 0, "-ne" is a comparison operator which means "not equal". So the expression means that if the effective user ID of the current user is not equal to 0, then the condition is true. In other words, the script is checking whether the user running the script has root privileges because the root user has an effective user ID of 0.

Therefore, the expression is commonly used at the beginning of a script to check whether the script is being executed with root privileges. If the condition is true, the script will terminate or exit with an error message since some commands may require root privileges to run successfully.

In Bash shell, comparison operators are used to compare values or expressions and return a Boolean result (true or false) depending on whether the comparison is true or false. Here are some of the commonly used comparison operators in Bash:

-eq: used to check if two integers are equal.

-ne: used to check if two integers are not equal.

-gt: used to check if the first integer is greater than the second integer.

-ge: used to check if the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer.

-lt: used to check if the first integer is less than the second integer.

-le: used to check if the first integer is less than or equal to the second integer.

==: used to check if two strings are equal.

!=: used to check if two strings are not equal.

-z: used to check if a string is empty.

-n: used to check if a string is not empty.


These comparison operators are usually used in conditional statements such as if-else statements and loops to execute certain actions based on the result of the comparison.
